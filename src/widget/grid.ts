/**
 * The chart grid: several widgets in one workspace.
 *
 * `createChartGrid(container, options)` lays one widget out per cell on a rows
 * by columns grid, puts splitters between the tracks, keeps one cell active,
 * links the charts through the engine's link groups, and reads and writes the
 * portable payload of `openalgo-charts/workspace`, so a saved desk opens here
 * with the geometry, weights, focus and links it was saved with.
 *
 * Decisions worth recording:
 *
 * - **Every cell is an ordinary widget.** The grid adds layout, focus and
 *   linking around them and reaches each one through its public API, so a
 *   cell loads, cancels and tears down its own feed exactly as a lone widget.
 * - **One active cell answers the keyboard.** Every widget listens on the
 *   document, so without a referee one chord reaches each chart the pointer or
 *   the focus happens to touch. Other cells are silenced through
 *   `keyboardRoute`, and a key pressed with the focus on the page itself goes
 *   to the active chart while the pointer is over the grid.
 * - **Applying a workspace is all or nothing.** The new cells are built and
 *   restored off to the side; the first failure destroys them, which cancels
 *   their history requests, and the charts on screen are never touched.
 * - **A view set by data is not a pan.** A chart fitting bars it has just
 *   received moves its window, and broadcasting that to a follower on another
 *   timeframe would squeeze the follower's data into a sliver. Data-driven
 *   moves stay local; linked views converge on the next real pan or zoom.
 * - **Each chart keeps drawings per instrument, for itself.** A cell's store
 *   is its own, keyed by its pane id: two cells on one symbol writing one
 *   shared document would each overwrite the other's lines. The documents of
 *   the instruments a cell is not showing are saved beside the workspace,
 *   whose own payload carries only what each chart shows.
 * - **Maximizing is a view, not a layout.** It shows the active chart alone
 *   the way the compact width does, keeps every other chart alive behind it,
 *   and is not saved: a desk reopens as the grid it is.
 * - **The grid's chrome is the host's choice.** The bar over the charts and
 *   the one under them are off unless asked for, so a host with controls of
 *   its own keeps its page as it was, and each chart keeps its own Go to and
 *   market status until a bar under the grid takes them over.
 *
 * The grid's state is one object, `GridState`, that the functions here share
 * with the parts split out of this file: grid-persist.ts (the saved desk),
 * grid-tracks.ts (the tracks and their splitters) and grid-capture.ts (one
 * picture of every chart).
