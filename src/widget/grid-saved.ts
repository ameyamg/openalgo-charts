/**
 * The chart grid's saved layouts: one layouts controller over the whole
 * desk, which the grid bar's Layouts control opens the widget's own Layouts
 * menu on.
 *
 * Its own module so grid.ts carries only the option and the mount call. It
 * reaches the grid through its public API alone, as a host building its own
 * controller over a grid would.
 *
 * Three decisions worth recording:
 *
 * - **A layout of the desk is what is on the charts.** It is `getWorkspace`
 *   with each chart written as the widget writes one (`layoutChartState`:
 *   no view, no alert bookkeeping), and without the focus: which chart is
 *   active changes with every click, and a layout that held it would read as
 *   unsaved, and cost an autosave write, at each one. An opened layout makes
 *   its first chart active.
 * - **The grid builds its own controller only with the bar that shows it.**
 *   A controller that autosaves and reopens the last layout at page load,
 *   with no control to say so, would change a host's page behind its back.
 * - **The last layout reopens once the grid's own desk has landed**, so the
 *   two never race, and a layout replaces the persisted desk as opening it
 *   from the menu would. A desk opened before it could (a host's hand-off
 *   from another page, a file, the menu) is the newer choice, and stays.
