/**
 * The shell's persisted state: the saved layout read before the shell is
 * built and applied once it is, each instrument's drawings kept beside it,
 * the debounced write after a change and the flush when the page goes away,
 * and `restoreState` applying a state a host kept.
 *
 * Over an asynchronous store (IndexedDB, the default) nothing saved can be
 * read while the shell is built. The shell is built on the defaults and kept
 * out of sight, its first load is held, and `restoreWhenLoaded` applies the
 * saved facts, drawings and layout once the store has answered, then starts
 * the load. Until then no save is written, so a slow store cannot have the
 * defaults written over the layout it has not returned yet, and the drawings
 * follow no instrument, so none is read from a copy not filled yet. A choice
 * the user or the host made in the meantime (a symbol, an interval, a whole
 * `restoreState`) is newer than the stored one and wins over it.
 *
 * Its own module so persistence can grow (an asynchronous store, a layouts
 * catalog) while widget.ts stays under its line cap. The shell calls each
 * function with itself as `this`, typed `PersistHost`, for the reasons
 * widget-keys.ts gives: a member the shell renames or retypes fails to
 * compile here, and the moved code reads and compresses as it did in
 * widget.ts. The tier entry exports none of it: the names hosts import
 * (`stripView` and the storage constants) stay declared in widget.ts.
 * `_scheduleSave` and `_saveNow` stay on the shell as one-line delegates,
 * because every change the shell follows schedules a save and `destroy`
 * writes the last one, and the timer's callback here calls back through them.

 * change and a toast for each would bury the chart.
