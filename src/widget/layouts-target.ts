/**
 * One widget as the target of a layouts controller: its state as a portable
 * one-chart workspace payload, and a saved one-chart layout put back through
 * `restoreState`.
 *
 * Built from the widget's public state alone, so the widget tier needs no
 * code from the workspace tier to save a layout: the payload is written here
 * in the form `migrateWidgetWorkspace` produces, and the store parses it.
 *
 * Two decisions worth recording:
 *
 * - **A layout is what is on the chart, not where it was scrolled.** The
 *   capture leaves out the viewport, the bar spacing and every pinned price
 *   range (`stripView`), as a layout opened on another symbol already did.
 *   Otherwise every pan, and every bar a live feed adds, would read as an
 *   unsaved change and cost an autosave write; an opened layout fits the
 *   bars it loads instead.
 * - **A layout holds the alerts the user set, not how far they have judged
 *   the feed.** Each closed bar moves an alert's bookkeeping (the last bar
 *   judged, the last touch and trigger), so keeping it would mark the layout
 *   unsaved on every bar, and two tabs holding it would each write it and
 *   refuse the other. An alert's `state` stays: a spent alert is kept spent.
 *   A restored alert is judged from the loaded bars onwards, as after a reload.
 * - **A replay suspends it.** While a replay owns the chart its bars stop at a
 *   moment in the past; autosave waits for the replay to end, and a layout is
 *   not opened under it.
