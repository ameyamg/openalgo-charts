/**
 * The parts of the widget that load on first use.
 *
 * A plain widget never opens the shortcuts editor, the Layouts menu, the
 * indicator templates list or the chart data dialog, never shows a grid's
 * bar or its menus, and persists nothing to IndexedDB, so none of them rides
 * in the tier's own file: the build writes each one beside it
 * (rollup.config.js) and `import()` fetches it the first time it is needed.
 * The script-tag build is the exception: a classic script cannot share a
 * chunk, so its widget file carries the parts and `import()` settles with no
 * fetch.
 * Once a part has arrived it is used at once, as if it had been bundled in;
 * until then the request waits for it. A load that fails is reported where
 * the user asked, and forgotten, so the next request asks again rather than
 * waiting on a promise that has already failed. A browser keeps a failed
 * module fetch for the life of the page, so there the answer stays the same
 * until the page reloads; a loader that retries gets its retry.
 *
 * Each part is declared beside the code that uses it. The tier entry exports
 * none of this.
