/**
 * Chart linking groups: a grid of charts that behaves as one workspace.
 *
 * Headless, in the spirit of `ComparisonController` and `ReplayController`. It
 * ships no DOM, so the host draws its own link badge / colour chips and decides
 * which charts belong to which group.
 *
 * Each channel switches independently because a user routinely
 * wants one without the others (mirror the cursor across four timeframes but
 * keep each zoom; or slave every chart's symbol but let each keep its own
 * window):
 *
 * - **crosshair**: hovering one chart marks the same instant on the others.
 * - **viewport**: panning or zooming one moves the others to the same window.
 * - **symbol**: changing the instrument on one changes it on the others.
 * - **interval**: changing a timeframe asks each following host to adopt it.
 * - **chartType**: changing the chart style (candles, bars, a line) asks each
 *   following host to adopt it, the same way. Colours, scales and the status
 *   line are appearance, not chart type: a user linking candles to candles
 *   may well want each chart's own colours.
 * - **appearance**: visual settings pass through a structural host adapter.
 * - **drawings**: the group decides which charts share drawings, and the draw
 *   tier moves them, only between charts on the same instrument. See `./drawings`.
 *
 * Four decisions carry the design.
 *
 * 1. **Everything crosses a chart boundary as a time, never as a logical
 *    index.** See `./align`. This is the whole difficulty of the feature: the
 *    naive version works perfectly on two charts of the same symbol and
 *    interval, which is how it would ship broken.
 *
 * 2. **A follower's crosshair is a primitive, not the chart's own crosshair.**
 *    The engine's crosshair belongs to the pointer inside that chart; a linked
 *    one is a second, weaker mark that must not fight it. See `./crosshair`.
 *
 * 3. **One re-entrancy guard covers every channel.** A syncs B, B echoes
 *    back to A, and the pair either oscillates forever or blows the stack. Any
 *    member event that arrives *while the group is broadcasting* is an echo of
 *    that broadcast by definition (a human cannot pan two charts in one call
 *    stack), so it is dropped. The guard is deliberately group-wide rather than
 *    per channel: a symbol change that reloads data can move a viewport, and
 *    that second-order echo is the same bug wearing a different hat.
 *
 * 4. **The group never keeps a destroyed chart alive.** `Chart.destroy` sets
 *    `isDestroyed` and emits `'destroy'`, so a member is released the moment it
 *    dies rather than at the next channel event. A `LinkChart` that is not a
 *    `Chart` may report neither, so members are also probed by pane count
 *    before every use (the price pane can never be removed by any other route) and
 *    dropped on the spot, which matters because `addPrimitive` on a destroyed
 *    chart would resurrect a pane.
 *
 * The host owns instrument selection and loading. It tells the group a selection changed (by
 * emitting `'symbol'` on the chart's own event bus, or by calling `setSymbol`),
 * and it supplies the per-member `onSymbol` callback that actually loads the
 * new instrument's bars. A member without `onSymbol` broadcasts symbol changes
 * but never receives them, which is how a host pins one chart of a grid.
