 *   as a swing point and starts a falling swing at the bar's low. A falling
 *   swing is the mirror image. A bar that makes a new extreme extends the swing
 *   even when its other end would also have reversed it, and a tie keeps the
 *   earlier bar.
 * - Before the first reversal the highest high and the lowest low since the
 *   first bar are both open, and the first time they lie `deviation` percent
 *   apart, the earlier of the two becomes the first swing point.
 *
 * `zigzag` holds each swing point's price on its own bar, the running end of
 * the last leg included, and nothing elsewhere; the legs are drawn between
 * them, the last one dashed. Only the last leg ever repaints. On a live tick
 * that makes a new extreme its end moves onto the forming bar and the bar it
 * left reads empty again; a tick that retraces by `deviation` confirms the end
 * and starts a new last leg on the forming bar; a corrected bar can move the
 * end back. Confirmed swing points never move, and `calcTail` returns exactly
 * what a full `calc` of the same bars does (see `zigzagTail`).
 *
 * The legs are shapes, not a plot, so a leg is straight on a logarithmic scale
 * too, and they take their colour, opacity, thickness and line style from the
 * plot's own style settings.
