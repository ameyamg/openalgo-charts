/**
 * The draw items one series hands its renderer each frame, built without
 * allocating per bar.
 *
 * The series pass runs on every frame of a pan, a zoom or a live tick, and it
 * used to build two fresh objects for every visible bar each time: the
 * data layer's `{ index, bar }` pair and the renderer's `{ x, bar }` item, and
 * the autoscale walk built the pairs again. Nothing kept any of it past the
 * frame; it was garbage for the collector at the rate of the frame times the
 * bars in view (scripts/bench-pane.mjs measures it). Here the visible bars are
 * walked in place and written into items owned by the series, reused from one
 * frame to the next.
 *
 * Contract for a renderer or a render backend: `items`, and the objects in it,
 * are valid until the same series is drawn again. Anything kept longer has to
 * be copied. They are the bars in view, and for a renderer that joins
 * neighbouring bars (`RendererEntry.connectsBars`) the series' nearest bar
 * beyond each edge as well, marked with the edge it lies beyond
 * (`DrawItem.edgeX`).
