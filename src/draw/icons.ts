/**
 * Glyphs for the drawing tools and for host chrome, as path data.
 *
 * The engine ships no DOM, and this does not change that: an icon here is a
 * string of SVG path commands, not an element. The host still builds its own
 * toolbar, flyouts and rail; what it no longer has to do is draw every glyph
 * before it can show them. `icon-svg.ts` turns these into markup strings for a
 * host that wants the convenience; this file is the single source both of them
 * and every other surface read from.
 *
 * That was the real cost of leaving them out. Every adopter drew their own set,
 * each drifted on stroke weight, grid and visual density independently, and the
 * result read as sixty icons rather than as one set, however carefully any
 * single glyph was made. A shipped set is worth more than a better glyph.
 *
 * # Two tiers, one line
 *
 * Tool glyphs live on a 24-unit grid and are shown at 24px in the rail. Host
 * chrome (undo, close, the settings tab rail) is shown at 16px beside them, and
 * a 24-grid glyph scaled to 16 lands its 2-unit stroke on 1.33 pixels, blurred
 * across two rows on every edge. So chrome has its own registry drawn on a
 * 16-unit grid. Both tiers draw a 2-unit stroke, and since each is shown at its
 * grid size, that is the same 2px line on screen in both rails: a lock under
 * the tools reads as part of the same set, only smaller.
 *
 * The chrome stroke was 1.5 through 2.5.5, chosen to match the tool weight as a
 * fraction of the box. On integer coordinates a 1.5 stroke covers 0.75 of two
 * pixel rows, so no edge was ever solid (0.18 of its inked pixels, against 0.59
 * for the tools). A 1px stroke on half-unit coordinates was tried as well: as
 * crisp on straight edges, but faint on every curve and visibly lighter than
 * the tool rail beside it, on both themes. Two it is, with the few glyphs that
 * were too dense for it redrawn with more air.
 *
 * # The grid
 *
 * Every glyph is authored to the same constraints, and `tests/draw-icons.test.ts`
 * enforces all of them mechanically, because a set of this size cannot be kept
 * consistent by review:
 *
 *  - **One viewBox per tier.** 24 by 24 for tools, 16 by 16 for chrome, so a
 *    host sets the size once per surface.
 *  - **A margin all round.** Live area 2 to 22 on the tool grid, 2 to 14 on the
 *    chrome grid, so the ink stops a pixel short of the box. Without it,
 *    glyphs that happen to reach the edge look larger than their neighbours
 *    and the rail reads as ragged.
 *  - **Integer coordinates.** With a stroke of 2, an orthogonal edge centred on
 *    an integer covers exactly two device pixels at 1:1, which is what makes it
 *    crisp.
 *  - **One stroke weight.** Different weights across identically sized boxes
 *    is the single most visible tell of a set assembled rather than drawn.
 *  - **The whole glyph in its path.** The marks that tell siblings apart (a
 *    segment ends in two dots, a ray starts at one, a path ends in a head)
 *    are small closed shapes drawn in the path itself, so a host that renders
 *    the path data and nothing else still gets every one of them. An accent
 *    registry repeats those marks for a fill on top: a dot then paints solid
 *    rather than as a ring, which adds weight, never identity.
 *
 * # Rendering
 *
 * Tool glyphs are crispest at 24px, and at any integer multiple of it. At 18px
 * the 0.75 scale puts a 2-unit stroke on 1.5 device pixels and every edge is
 * anti-aliased across two rows: that is a host sizing choice, not something the
 * path data can fix. Prefer 24, or 12 with a heavier weight. Chrome glyphs are
 * drawn for 16px and its multiples.
