/**
 * The drawing layer's hit prefilter: for each drawing, a box outside which its
 * tool can never report a hit, so a pointer move asks only the drawings near
 * the pointer rather than every drawing on the pane.
 *
 * A layer holds every drawing of its pane in one primitive, so the pane's own
 * prefilter (`IPrimitive.hitBounds`) sees one box the size of the plot and
 * asks the layer on every move. Five hundred drawings then cost five hundred
 * projections and five hundred distance calls per move.
 *
 * A box is worked out from the geometry the tool's `distance` answers from:
 * its anchors in media px, the drawing's style, and the render context. It
 * covers every point where that distance is at most the grab radius, which is
 * why the radius is part of it: an ellipse's distance is scaled by its short
 * axis, so the region it grabs grows faster than the radius along the long
 * one. Only tools whose geometry is written out here get a box. Any other
 * tool, a host's own included, and a built-in id a host has registered again
 * with its own implementation, are asked on every move as before, since the
 * box table knows the built-in objects and not their ids.
 *
 * Boxes are kept, by the drawing's place in the layer's paint order, while a
 * key reads the same: what projects an anchor (the time scale, the bars'
 * times, the price scale), the plot size, the grab radii, the tool registered
 * under each id the layer uses, and the loaded fonts, which decide the box of
 * a text. A new drawing list lets every box go, since the controller edits
 * drawings in place and hands the list over again.
