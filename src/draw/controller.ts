/**
 * Drawing controller: the interaction and persistence layer over
 * `DrawingLayer`. It is **headless**: no DOM, no toolbar. A host sets the
 * active tool (from its own button, a shortcut, a command palette) and the
 * controller runs placement, selection, dragging, undo, and serialisation.
 *
 * It listens on the chart's event bus (`click`, `crosshair:move`, `drag`,
 * `drag:end`) rather than the single-slot `subscribeClick`/`subscribeDrag`
 * callbacks, so a host keeps using those for its own order lines.
 *
 * Selection is a list. Every method that edits takes the whole list into one
 * undo entry, so a multi-drag, a batch delete or a paste of ten shapes is one
 * Ctrl+Z, which is what the hand that did it expects.
 */
// Shared types come from the package entry, not a relative path: each tier

// is a different type, and a consumer passing the real one got "separate
// declarations of a private property". The entry is external to tier builds,
// so this survives as `from 'openalgo-charts'` and stays one identity.
