/**
 * Every tier is its own bundle, so anything it deep-imports from the base is
 * inlined: a second, private copy. That is only a size cost for pure
 * functions, but for the registries (chart types, indicators) it is a
 * correctness bug: a tier would register into a Map that `createChart` never
 * reads. Tiers therefore import shared runtime state from `openalgo-charts`,
 * which is external for tier builds and emitted as a plain import.
 *
 * The same rule holds one level up. The widget builds on the draw tier (the
 * controller, the icon sprite, the tool registry), so `openalgo-charts/draw`
 * and every other tier specifier are external too. A widget that inlined the
 * draw tier would carry a second `DrawingController` class and a second tool
 * table, and `instanceof` would stop agreeing across them; `check-dts.mjs`
 * fails the build if a tier's declarations inline one of those classes.

/**
 * The widget loads the UI a user has to open (the shortcuts editor, the
 * Layouts menu, the templates list, the grid bar's menus) with `import()`
 * on first use (src/widget/lazy.ts). Those chunks are written beside the tier
 * as `openalgo-charts.widget.<part>-<hash>.mjs`: a chunk resolves against the
 * tier's own URL, so a CDN or `type="module"` page needs nothing more, and a bundler
 * follows the import and splits it the same way. Every other tier is one file.
 * The tier file itself keeps everything a widget loads before anyone opens a
 * part: `allow-extension` lets the chunks import the shell's helpers from it,
 * where rollup would otherwise move the whole shell into a second chunk behind
 * a re-exporting facade, and the tier's size row would measure the facade.
 * Those helpers go by minified names that change from build to build, so a
 * part only works with the tier file it was built with. The content hash in
 * its name makes a new tier file ask for its own parts, never an old copy a
 * browser or proxy kept from the release before. `npm run build` empties dist/
 * first, or a rebuild would leave the previous parts there for `npm pack` and
 * the parts' size row to pick up.

/**
 * The script-tag build: one classic script per tier, for a page that loads no
 * modules. The base file defines the `OpenAlgoCharts` global, as it always
 * has, and each tier file adds itself to it under its subpath name, so
 * `import { X } from 'openalgo-charts/draw'` reads `OpenAlgoCharts.draw.X`.
 * A key per tier rather than one flat object keeps two tiers' names from
 * colliding (base and widget both export `withAlpha`, with different code).
 *
 * A tier file leaves the same specifiers external as its ESM build and reads
 * them from that global, for the reason given where `PKG` is defined: it must
 * register into the base the page loaded, never a private copy. Its banner stops it before it
 * runs when what it reads is missing, and names the files to load first,
 * where it would otherwise fail somewhere inside with a bare TypeError.
 *
 * The widget's first-use parts are bundled into its file. A classic script
 * cannot share a split chunk, and a part fetched as a module would import the
 * ESM base and widget files, whose registries are not the ones on the page.
